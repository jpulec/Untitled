==========RPG Ideas==============

4 or 5 set characters, no swapping, designed to allow char devel, and better story

NO Magic, and hopefully really no substitute (tech, etc.)

Allow the game to be played how a player wishes to (kinda a leaf from IJ:FoA, wits, team, power, but not identical)
What are ways people resolve life issues? (example, what can I do if an angry bar patron approaches me):
1. cooperation/persuasion (team, work together)
2. force    (violence, etc.)
3. smarts   (be sneaky,subversive, clever, maybe convince him to get himself hurt)
4. ignore it (sometimes bad results)

Avoid lame RPG cliches

Fantasy world, not intended to be current earth in future, or anything like that

Technology level, probably reasonably current, maybe a bit behind

Characters not very customizable, set base classes
NO visible stats, health, etc. NO numbers
